# RetroMUDlet

## Introduction

This is a set of Mudlet packages for RetroMUD.

## Installation

Download the desired packages and add them to Mudlet via the packages menu.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you install the RetroMUDlet-Shared package!

## Usage

Each package contains a set of aliases and triggers for the corresponding guild. Load it into Mudlet.
Further information will be found in the package's README.
Some packages may have overlapping items (e.g. multiple guilds get the feather weight spell).
In these instances, you'll need to disable duplicates to avoid issues.
Egregious examples like feather weight may be moved into their own package in the future to avoid this.

## Contributing

I'm using [Muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler) to build the packages.
I'm also using the Mudlet SDK extension for Visual Studio Code, and I recommend you do as well.
Feel free to add more guilds or add to existing guilds, just note the way the existing file trees work.
If you have any questions, please reach out to me in-game.
Preset variables (not generated by script) are not currently supported by Muddler.
If your script requires a variable be present, you'll need to have a mechanism that creates it.
